Grace Chouinard
    Hi, I'm Grace Chouinard. This website was defintely a learning point for me. I am not great at designing things, so when it came to designing this website, it was a challenge. But, with my classmates, we were able to improve the design. I enjoyed working on this project, especially when things would go my way, like when I figured out how to work the dropdown menu on the About page. I think, with me not being great at designing, the About page looks great! I figured out to make a "back to top" button and everything else on the about page. I worked on that page so long I did not have as much time to work on the Home page, so I defintely feel I could have done better, but it still looks great. The logo is probably my favorite part of the website. Thank you!

Hi, I'm Lance Brooks. The most difficult challenge was my clothes title not being centered I tried so many things change the style css, the id, and the class nothing worked but as soon as i changed the colume it centered. The thing i most enjoyed was working with this group and making new friends.

Hi, I'm Caden Davis! I made the fonts that are featured on this website. I also proofread the website to check for any grammatical errors!!!!
